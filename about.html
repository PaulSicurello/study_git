                <p class="text-left">My name is Paul Sicurello and I am a professional Website Designer. I am dedicated to professional service, quality web design, and trustworthy results; creating highly functional user interfaces with the perfect mixture of simplicity, elegance, and innovation. I would like to welcome you to my Website, and share my passion for Photography, Web Design and Graphic Design with you; but first, let me give you some background about who I am.</p>
                <p class="text-left"> I live in Oviedo, Florida. I was born in New Jersey and lived there for thirty years. I&#39;m interested in Photography, Graphic Design, Web Design and Development, Culinary Arts and Classical Literature. I realized that I had a passion for building websites in the early 90&#39;s. I started to work with HTML and, more recently, with JavaScript. Then I learned CSS, which made my life a lot easier. On the Graphic Design side, I have worked extensively with Adobe products such as Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and Dreamweaver. As I developed my skills in Photoshop, I realized that I have a passion for Photography.</p>
                <p class="text-left">I took relevant courses at Spokane Community College and Eastern Washington University and I have been studying using Lynda.com for quite a while. My goal is simple â€“ to ensure beautiful, usable interfaces through semantic code that produces a satisfying experience for every visitor to your website. While my vision is noble, I back up that vision with reliable, trustworthy, professional service, high-quality industry competence, and unparalleled creativity and passion that make a distinct difference in the designs I create.</p>
                <p class="text-left"> A unique, high-quality Website Design attracts customers and helps you close the sale by making your call to action tantalizing and easy to locate. I know how important your business is and strive to deliver creative ideas and the most relevant solution for your projects. I will help you brainstorm and provide solid, trustworthy advice to make sure I meet your expectations.</p>
